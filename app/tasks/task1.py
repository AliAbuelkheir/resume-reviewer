    "You MUST treat this execution as fully isolated: no prior resumes, no cached memory, and no external documents exist. "
    "Analyze the entire document (experience, education, skills, certifications, projects). "
    "Strict Rules:\n"
    "- Only include information explicitly present in the PDF.\n"
    "- Do NOT infer or hallucinate missing dates, employers, degrees, or skills.\n"
    "- Every keyword MUST appear verbatim (case-insensitive) or as a simple stem (e.g., 'analyzing' vs 'analyze').\n"
    "- If uncertain whether a concept is present, exclude it.\n"
    "- No external knowledge injection.\n"
    "Flexibility:\n"
    "- Include ALL relevant keywords: technical, tools, methodologies, domains, soft skills, certifications.\n"
    "- The keyword list length is flexibleâ€”prefer completeness over brevity.\n"
    "Quality:\n"
    "- JSON only. No comments, no markdown, no surrounding text.\n"
    "- Preserve meaning; keep summary factual and grounded in text."
